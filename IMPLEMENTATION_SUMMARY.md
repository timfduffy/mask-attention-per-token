# Implementation Summary

## What's Been Implemented

✅ Complete token masking analysis system with the following features:

### Core Features

1. **Masking Approach**: Attention logits set to `-inf` (Approach 2 as discussed)
   - True removal from attention computation
   - Other tokens renormalized without masked token
   
2. **Three Variants Measured**:
   - **Full**: Complete residual stream update (attention + MLP)
   - **Attn**: Attention-only contribution
   - **Head_N**: Individual head contributions for all heads

3. **Distance Metrics**:
   - L2 distance: Magnitude of change
   - Cosine distance: Directional change

4. **Measurement Focus**: Final token position only (as requested)

5. **Device Support**: Both CPU and GPU via `device` parameter

### Key Implementation Details

- **Model**: Qwen3-0.6B (loaded from local directory: `H:\Models\huggingface\Qwen3-0.6B`)
- **Library**: Native `transformers` (no TransformerLens dependency)
- **Manual Forward Pass**: Custom implementation to capture all activations
- **Rotary Embeddings**: Properly handled
- **Grouped-Query Attention**: Supported (KV head repetition)
- **Output Format**: Long format CSV as requested

## Files Created

1. **`mask_impact_analysis.py`**: Main implementation
   - `AttentionMasker` class: Handles all masking and activation extraction
   - `run_masking_experiment()`: Main entry point
   - Helper functions for distance computation, rotary embeddings, etc.

2. **`test_single_layer.py`**: Quick test script
   - Tests just first layer, first token
   - Useful for debugging and verification
   - Prints shapes and sample distances

3. **`analyze_results.py`**: Results analysis
   - Load and summarize CSV results
   - Find most impactful tokens/layers/heads
   - Basic statistics and insights

4. **`requirements.txt`**: Dependencies
   - torch >= 2.0.0
   - transformers >= 4.40.0
   - pandas >= 2.0.0
   - numpy >= 1.24.0

5. **`README.md`**: Complete documentation
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Implementation details
   - Expected insights

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Initial Testing (CPU)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Quick test
python test_single_layer.py
```

### 2. Full Experiment

```bash
# CPU (for initial testing)
python mask_impact_analysis.py

# Or directly in Python
python
>>> from mask_impact_analysis import run_masking_experiment
>>> df = run_masking_experiment("The Eiffel Tower is in", device='cpu')
>>> df.to_csv('results.csv', index=False)
```

### 3. Move to GPU

```python
from mask_impact_analysis import run_masking_experiment

# Run on GPU
df = run_masking_experiment(
    prompt="The Eiffel Tower is in",
    device='cuda'
)
df.to_csv('results_gpu.csv', index=False)
```

### 4. Analyze Results

```bash
python analyze_results.py
```

## Output Format

CSV with columns:
- `layer`: Layer index (0 to N-1)
- `token_masked`: The token that was masked
- `token_position`: Position of masked token
- `variant`: "Full", "Attn", or "Head_N"
- `l2_distance`: L2 distance metric
- `cosine_distance`: Cosine distance metric

## Expected Output Size

For the test prompt "The Eiffel Tower is in":
- 6 tokens
- Number of layers varies by model (check model.config.num_hidden_layers)
- Number of heads varies by model (check model.config.num_attention_heads)
- 3 main variants + N head variants

Note: Exact row count will depend on your specific model's architecture.

## Computational Complexity

For N tokens, L layers, H heads:
- Baseline runs: L (one per layer)
- Masked runs: N × L (each token at each layer)
- Total forward passes: L + (N × L) = L × (N + 1)

Example: If your model has 28 layers and prompt has 6 tokens: 28 × (6 + 1) = **196 forward passes**

## Next Steps

1. Run `test_single_layer.py` to verify everything works
2. Run full experiment with `mask_impact_analysis.py`
3. Analyze results with `analyze_results.py`
4. Optionally: Modify for your specific needs
   - Different prompts
   - Different models
   - Different position focus (currently final token only)
   - Multiple prompts in batch

## Technical Notes

### Why Manual Forward Pass?

We manually implement the forward pass through layers instead of using hooks because:
1. Need to inject masking into attention computation
2. Need to capture per-head outputs before combination
3. Need precise control over activation extraction
4. Cleaner and more maintainable than complex hook interactions

### Masking Implementation

```python
# Attention scores: [batch, num_heads, seq_len, seq_len]
attn_weights[:, :, :, mask_position] = float('-inf')
```

This masks attention **TO** the masked position across all query positions and heads.

### Per-Head Extraction

Per-head outputs are captured **before** the output projection:
```python
# Shape: [batch, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim]
per_head_outputs = attn_output  # Before combining heads
```

This gives us the pure head contributions without projection mixing.

## Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory
- Use CPU first: `device='cpu'`
- Test with fewer layers using `test_single_layer.py`
- Use smaller model if needed

### Wrong Model Architecture
- Code is designed for Qwen architecture (Qwen3, Qwen2.5, etc.)
- May need adjustments for other model families
- Check `model.config` attributes match expected names

### Unexpected Results
- Verify masking is working: check if distances are non-zero
- Compare baseline vs masked activations manually
- Use `test_single_layer.py` for detailed debugging
